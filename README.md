# mpags-cipher
A simple command line tool for encrypting/decrypting text using classical ciphers

We will create a command line tool that can read plaintext from either they keyboard or a file and allows the user to choose whether to encrypt/decrypt the file with a choice of 3 ciphers: caesar, vigenere or playfair. The tool will also then be able to write the output to the screen or to a file.
